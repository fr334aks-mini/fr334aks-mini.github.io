We managed to solve 21/29 challenges where we emerged 44/285 teams with 2750 points. In general, the challenges were fun despite a few challenges with the Infra.

We are presented with a `.wav` file and the first thing that comes to my mind is using [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/download/) & [Sonic Visualizer](https://www.sonicvisualiser.org/download.html) to check if the flag is visible on the spectogram. Turns out that was a dead end. After sometime of research, i came across a tool on github that could get the flag, `stegolsb`. To install it, simply run:

```
git clone https://github.com/ragibson/Steganography
cd Steganography
python3 setup.py install
```

`stegolsb wavsteg -r -i sound_steg.wav -o output.txt -n 1 -b 1000`

Breaking down the command above:

- WavSteg uses least significant bit steganography to hide a file in the samples of a .wav file.
- `-r` - is for recovering data from a sound file.
- `-i` - Path to a .wav file.
- `-o` - Path to an output file.
- `-n` - lsb-count (How many LSBs to use [default: 2])
- `-b` - How many bytes to recover from the sound file
